APPLE is a fruit loved by many,
but when you say APPLE,
you might also think of ApPle,
the tech company that’s transformed the world.

APPLE, in its simplest form,
is a snack that’s good for you,
but ApPle, with its sleek gadgets,
can change the way you live.

It’s fascinating how the word APPLE appears in so many forms—
whether it’s the crunchy, juicy apple you eat,
or the devices from ApPle that keep you connected.

People often debate the merits of APPLE versus aPplE,
as if the lowercase or uppercase versions change the essence of the thing itself.

When you buy an APPLE phone,
are you getting the same satisfaction as when you bite into a crisp, fresh apple?

Maybe both APPLE and aPplE hold equal value in their respective realms—
one nourishes the body,
and the other fuels the digital age.

Whether you're indulging in an APPLE
or relying on ApPle’s innovations,
the influence of APPLE, in any form, is undeniable.
